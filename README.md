# Description
Simple project using React and node.js to solidify knowledge about these areas, based on the project created during Next Level Week #2, offered by RocketSeat.

The idea is to make a platform where people can meet and share books, expanding knowledge around the world with this simple act.

# Project Structure
```
/web // Front-end web application based on simplified common react app structure with typescript template
     // Created using npx create-react-app web --template typescript
```

```
/server // Back-end server application using typescript for data management and storage
        // Created using a simple typescript server architecture
```

## Front-end
Contains public index.html file and src files, organized by pages, common components and assets. Each page and component has it's own style sheet, which together with a global style sheet, give the project a face in web browsers.
Concepts applied: 
- Generating routes using 'react-router-dom';
- Code reuse through components;
- Setting and using properties of components (props);
- State setting and update;
- Interface for components creation using typescript;
- Responsive web design.

## Back-end
Contains main server and router files, along with other source files, such as database migrations and utils transforms.
Concepts applied: 
- Generating routes using 'express';
- Using migrations for better database version control;
- Transactions for database, allowing simpler rollback.

# ToDo/Doing
BackEnd and Mobile version under construction.
